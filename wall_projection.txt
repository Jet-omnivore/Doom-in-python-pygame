Angle A = Normal Angle
Angle B = V1 Angle
Angle C = Angle B - Angle A or (Normal Angle - V1 Angle) or NormalToV1Angle
Angle D = 90 - Angle C

We want to find the length of normal line or (PR)
First we find the Angle C by mod(subtracting Angle B by Angle A or vice versa)
then, we know that the PR is parallel to SR because both lines makes same angle (90) on vertex line(wall line)
so Angle C is equal to angle (SQP) they are alternate angles
angle D is equal to 90 - Angle C
now we can find the length of normal line
normal line = sin(Angle D) * (Distance from player to V1)
