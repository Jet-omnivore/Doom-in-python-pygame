# 🕹️ DOOM-Style Software Renderer in Pure Python and Pygame

  
A 2.5D software rasterizer inspired by the rendering system of the original **DOOM** (1993), written from scratch in **Python** using **Pygame** — no OpenGL, no GPU acceleration.

---


## ✅ Implemented Features

- 🧍 Player movement
- 🧱 Wall rendering via 2.5D rasterization
- 📦 Basic `.wad`/`.dbs` file support

## 🚧 Planned Features

- 🚧 Collision detection against environment
- 👾 Enemies and simple AI
- 🌇 Floor and ceiling rendering with textures
- 🗺️ Full `.wad` file support

## 📸 Demo

🚧 *This project is still under active development.*

A visual demo will be added once core rendering features (like stable wall/floor drawing and player movement) are complete.

Stay tuned!
